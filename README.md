# Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit (YHROCU) - Task Management System

## Project Overview
The Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit (YHROCU) requires a web-based workflow management system to facilitate the assignment and tracking of non-crime-related support tasks.

  - Task history is maintained without deletion permissions for users.
  - Supervisors can close or delete tasks.

- **User Roles & Permissions**
  - **User**: Can view and update assigned tasks.
  - **Supervisor**: Read-only access to all tasks and projects.
  - **Admin**: Can manage users, modify tasks, and delete tasks/projects.

- **Dashboard & Filtering**
  - Tasks are categorized and summarized on a dashboard.
  - Users can filter tasks by status, due date, and project.

- **Search & Export**
