# Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit (YHROCU) - Task Management System

## Project Overview
The Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit (YHROCU) requires a web-based workflow management system to facilitate the assignment and tracking of non-crime-related support tasks. This system aims to improve efficiency, oversight, and accountability in task management within the department.

## Key Features
- **Task Assignment & Notifications**
  - Users can be assigned individual or collaborative tasks.
  - Email notifications are sent upon task assignment.

- **Task Management**
  - Users can update task status, set due and review dates, and add progress updates.
  - Task history is maintained without deletion permissions for users.
  - Supervisors can close or delete tasks.

- **User Roles & Permissions**
  - **User**: Can view and update assigned tasks.
  - **Supervisor**: Read-only access to all tasks and projects.
  - **Admin**: Can manage users, modify tasks, and delete tasks/projects.

- **Dashboard & Filtering**
  - Tasks are categorized and summarized on a dashboard.
  - Users can filter tasks by status, due date, and project.

- **Search & Export**
  - Comprehensive search functionality for tasks.
  - Data export options in CSV or PDF format.

- **Security & Authentication**
  - User authentication via OpenAuth or similar.
  - System access restricted to internal users.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Web-based user interface.
- **Backend**: Python with Flask.
- **Database**: SQLlite
