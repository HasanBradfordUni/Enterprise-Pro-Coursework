        "- [x] Adam Shabbir at 01/10/2024 from ~16:00 to 16:28 - Making a class for accounts, which will contain account data. Just a general one for now, nothing unique yet.\n",
        "- [x] Adam Shabbir at 01/10/2024 from 20:26 to 21:13 - Login function works, but a while loop or for loop needs to be implemented to allow for the user to try again.\n",
        "- [x] Hasan Akhtar at 02/10/2024 from 07:06 to 07:13 - changed account reference to self to make specific to that object, added unit test for account in seperate cell, account still works and unit test good.\n",
        "- [x] Adam Shabbir at 04/10/2024 from ~18:00 to 19:15 - Trying to make a test to allow for a limited number of logging in attempts. Also made some notes for myself on what I think should be developed.\n",
        "- [x] Hasan Akhtar at 05/10/2024 from 16:36 to 18:15 - Making a class for storage and manipulation of all accounts (kinda like a mini database), updating Account class to include more essential methods, also adding Menu class to include interface methods of program. Added a unit test for each of these new additions. Features all fully working, just need minor improvements.\n",
        "- [x] Adam Shabbir at 06/10/2024 from 15:20 to 16:40 - Added finance accounts class to track finances.\n",
        "- [x] Hasan Akhtar at 06/10/2024 from 15:30 to 16:50 - Added admin account type and related methods, also added menu option 12 which allows and admin to add admin accounts, next need to add checks for admin permissions and new unit test, but this part now done.\n",
        "- [x] Adam Shabbir at 09/10/2024 from 08:00 to 09:30 - Worked on the FinanceOptions class. The finance Options class is not completed.\n",
        "- [x] Adam Shabbir at 11/10/2024 from 15:40 to 16:08 - Made minor fixes - Allowed the user to see their finance history, which shows their income and expenses. Finance options is still not completed, but significant progress made. Also wrote unit test for this, unit test shows that it is fully working at the moment.\n",
        "- [x] Hasan Akhtar + Adam Shabbir at 12/10/2024 from 15:45 to 16:16 - Hasan added the options dictionary in the constructor method attributes. Also adjusted the SeeFinanceHistory method to make it more user-friendly. Adam added in the displayMenu and getChoice methods thereafter. Hasan also filled in financeOptions method of Menu class to reflect the changes to the FinanceOptions class.\n",
        "- [x] Hasan Akhtar at 10/11/2024 from 09:30 to 10:30 - Added the Category class with its various methods. Also updated the Budgeting class to incorporate this new class.\n",
